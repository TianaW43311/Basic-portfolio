        <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, 
            but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional 
            period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't 
            give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already 
            been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it 
            over to your dumb ass.

            Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to 
            bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do.
             That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact
              same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some
               in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are 
               connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite 
               ends. </p>
